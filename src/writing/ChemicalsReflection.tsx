        This was the first piece I wrote for this course. To be honest, I didn't
        really know what I was doing. I knew that the First Pages book{" "}
        <span className="italic">Transcendent Kingdom</span> talked about trying
        and failing to view mental illness through an exclusively medical lens,
        so I decided to start by connecting that to my own experiences
        reconciling the dissonance between the medical terminology used to
        describe my depression and the socially-rooted causes of it. Once I had
        written down a few ideas, everything kind of flowed naturally. I feel
        like perhaps this was something I'd wanted to express for a while, but
        hadn't had a chance to get out.

        Any discussion of the medicalization of mental illness would be
        incomplete without mentioning how homophobia was once rationalized as
        simply "treating" homosexuality and helping those who "suffered" from it
        live a more "normal" and "healthy" life. This context was certainly at
        the front of my mind while I was writing this piece, and it's been at
        the front of my mind through my journey with treating my mental illness.
        That said, this piece was primarily about my own experiences, so I
        didn't explicitly mention it.

        This was a lot more personal than any writing I'd done in the past. To
        be honest, I used to always hate this kind of personal writing, so I
        kind of surprised myself by gravitating to it given the option and
        enjoying the entire writing process so much. I suppose it makes sense
        that I would enjoy writing about myself more now that I'm getting more
        comfortable with myself.

        Overall this piece kind of showed me, "whoa, maybe I'm not just a CS
        nerd." I really enjoyed writing it, and I'm quite happy with how it
        turned out.
