        Eula Biss' <span className="italic">"The Pain Scale"</span> reminded me
        of my own experiences with both the rigid medical criteria of
        transgender healthcare and the more fluid reality of transition and
        identity. I decided to write about the DSM-5 definition of gender
        dysphoria, since it was a similar arbitrary scale used in a medical
        context, and it was one I had personal experience with.
      </p>
      <p>
        I thought about including a section on how non-binary identities are
        left out by these diagnostic criteriaâ€”phrases added at the end such as
        "or some other gender" make it clearly seem like these identities were
        simply an afterthought. Fundamentally, though, that's not my experience,
        and I didn't find a good way to integrate it into the rest of the piece.
      </p>
      <p>
        In a way, this piece is kind of a sequel to{" "}
        <span className="italic">
          "The Problem That Needs Fixing Is With The Chemicals In My Brain."
        </span>{" "}
        Notably, though, that piece was about how I felt forced into a medical
        system because of my depression. This one is more about how I had to
        push myself into a medical system in order to seek acceptance and
        transition healthcare. Both do explore this concept of medical criteria
        being insufficient to describe the real world, though.
      </p>
      <p>
        This piece is a lot more optimistic than{" "}
        <span className="italic">Chemicals</span>. I think this reflects my
        growth as a person, as I've started to see my transgender status as less
        of a liability and more of an intrinsic part of myself.
