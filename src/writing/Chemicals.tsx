            So there's this video game I play sometimes. It's called Celeste.
            The main character, Madeline, is trying to climb a mountain. It’s
            what you might call a ‘platformer’ game--you have to get Madeline
            from platform to platform, jumping and dashing through the air. And
            it’s famously hard, requiring precise timing of just the right
            button inputs.
          </p>
          <p>
            Just as Madeline isn’t a mountain climber, I’m not much of a gamer.
            My hand-eye coordination is abysmal, and my ability to make
            split-second decisions isn’t great either. It took me months,
            attempt after attempt, sometimes grinding for hours just to get past
            a single screen of a level, but eventually, I made it to the summit.
          </p>
          <p>
            The mountain represents Madeline’s depression and her anxiety. Along
            the way, Madeline meets <Bl>Part of Her</Bl>. <Bl>Part of Her</Bl>{" "}
            tries to push her back down the mountain. <Bl>Part of Her</Bl> tries
            to tell her that she's not a mountain climber. <Bl>Part of Her</Bl>{" "}
            stalls the gondola she’s travelling on, causing Madeline to have a
            panic attack. And when Madeline tries to leave <Bl>Part of Her</Bl>{" "}
            behind, <Bl>Part of Her</Bl> knocks her down to the base of the
            mountain, making her climb all the way back up again.
          </p>
          <p>
            Then, Madeline talks to <Bl>Part of Her</Bl>. She asks{" "}
            <Bl>Part of Her</Bl> for help. She works with <Bl>Part of Her</Bl>{" "}
            to finish climbing the mountain. She works with <Bl>Part of Her</Bl>
            . She doesn't take medicine to turn <Bl>Part of Her</Bl> off.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>I took Madeline's name. I am Brooke Madeline Chalmers.</p>
          <p>
            What about <Bl>Part of Me</Bl>?

          i feel like i've got 4 options here
          <p>
            1. i come out as trans, quite possibly get laughed out of the room,
            start the long and humiliating role of trying to transition while my
            parents are super judge-y about it and probably aren't very
            supportive
          </p>
          <p>
            2. i tell her about my depression, and one of the four scenarios i
            talked about happens, like, it could go either way
          </p>
          <p>
            3. i continue to do nothing, and nothing really changes except I
            risk possibly ending up in the psych ward (and i probably risk my
            mom deciding that i have depression anyway, leading my down one of
            the same paths as #2)
          </p>
          <p>
            4. i kill myself before any of the above has a chance to happen -
            this one seems pretty appealing ngl, and it would probably be a
            no-brainer if it wasn't for the fact that my recent cutting has
            started boosting my mood and i'm not as impulsively suicidal anymore
          </p>
          <p>
            eh, who am i kidding, as long as i can manage to drive myself to the
            bridge, i'd jump without hesitation
          </p>
          <p>
            but like, if i try to tell my mom about having depression, i doubt
            anything productive would come from it, because
          </p>
          <p>
            5. it would require my mom admitting that her parenting wasn't
            spectacular, which i doubt she would be willing to admit, since she
            considers herself such a great ally to lgbt etc, and she's taken
            criticism as a personal attack before
          </p>
          <p>
            6. it would require me to come out as trans, which, uh, haha NOPE
          </p>
          <p>
            i guess i gotta find a different spot to cut... which i'm not doing
            very well at, considering i did more yeets in the same exposed place
            less than an hour ago
          </p>

            considered my current situation, examined my options, deliberated,
            and decided that I wanted to kill myself.
          </p>
          <p>
            And yet, something happened at the last minute that pulled me away.
          </p>
          <p>And yet, I'm still here.</p>
          <p>And yet, I don't want to die right now.</p>
          <p>And yet, I did back then.</p>
          <p>
            As much as I can try to tell myself that <Bl>I wasn't myself</Bl>,
            or that it was some <Bl>chemical imbalance</Bl>, or that the person
            who wrote those messages a year ago isn't the same person typing
            this on my laptop right now... deep down, I know it was. I wrote
            those words.

          i feel like i have too many masculine traits (not just physical but
          also like mannerisms and stuff) and i'd either never be able to pass
          as female or i'd kill myself from the stress of trying, and most
          likely the latter

          <p>It's not that I wasted years running away from life.</p>
          <p>
            It's not that I feel uncomfortable with every aspect about how I fit

            The problem that <Bl>needs fixing</Bl> is with the chemicals in my

          </p>
          <p>
            It's not that I spent so long being told by my family and society to

            It's not that I'm left with shattered remnants of my sense of

          <p>
            It's not that I'm somehow supposed to be a good student, be social,

            It's not that I'm left trying to figure out how to live, too
            dysphoric and uncomfortable to be a boy, but too tall and masculine
            and deep-voiced and awkward to be a girl.
          </p>
          <p>
            It's not that I need to learn everything about myself all over
            again, from what colors I like to what kind of clothes I like to
            wear, and I need to do it with that looming sense of self-doubt.

            It's not that every social interaction has become a minefield, every
            time I get dressed in the morning is a choice between the discomfort
            I'm familiar with and the discomfort I'm not, every class and club
            meeting requires solving a matrix equation of am I out to these
            people? do I know if they'll be supportive? do I know if I'll have
            the confidence to be okay if they aren't?, and every time I so much
            as walk through the IV lobby is a test of my sense of self.

          I'm rambling like, but honestly, I feel a lot less suicidal if I think
          about what 20-year-old Brooke would be like, then consider that I'd be
          killing her, not just present-me

            I might not enjoy my life very much, and I might be fine with ending

            I started taking antidepressants on January 9, 2021. And they
            helped.

          <p>
            I got the confidence to open up to a therapist. I gradually stopped
            cutting myself. I finally came out to my parents.

            Gradually, the voice in my head, the one telling me to kill
            myself... It started to quiet down.
