        I wrote this piece as an extra. I first watched Taran Van Hemert's video
        essay a few years ago, and it stuck with me. I've returned to watch it a
        few times since then.

        Just like Taran, I view myself as being more of a technical person. But
        over the years, I've written a few pieces here and there, and I started
        to realize that I enjoyed the writing process more than I thought I
        would. It started off technical--I would write up a short description of
        different projects I've worked on, or I would write some API
        documentation, or something else that I could convince myself was just
        descriptive, not creative.

        Over time, that illusion just kind of fell apart. I started to realize
        that writing, and art in general, wasn't just a means to an end for me.
        Taran's video helped me reconcile my own conflicting thoughts about my
        writing and grow to enjoy writing for its own sake.
