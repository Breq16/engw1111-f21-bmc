Earlier this year, for no reason other than boredom, I decided to try writing a short explanation of the Q_sqrt algorithm. For those unfamiliar with the intricacies of 90s-era computer graphics, Q_sqrt, also known as the “Fast Inverse Square Root” algorithm, is a method of quickly generating an approximation of the reciprocal of the square root of a number.

Q_sqrt is somehow both beautiful and ugly. It’s only 11 lines long, yet those lines are the most perplexing I’ve ever laid eyes on. It applies techniques from the field of logarithms and from calculus, yet it does so in a way that exploits the undefined behavior of the processor it runs on. A comment in the original source put it best. It simply states, “what the fuck?”

Eventually, my explanation reached the end of the function. I looked up at the clock. It was 3 in the morning. I had been writing this one post for twelve hours straight. I had just written a 2,249 word post about 11 lines of code in a video game nobody’s cared about in decades.

I stared at the ceiling in my room. Why in the world did I feel so compelled to write this? Why did I willingly spend an entire day bashing my head against the wall trying to understand this, just to write up an explanation for this long-forgotten piece of code, fully knowing that nobody would read it but myself?

Because I’m a writer.

For the longest time, I viewed writing as a means to an end. I viewed it as a way to get a grade, or to tell someone something, or to archive my thoughts for later retrieval.

But what was the “end” here? I already understood that algorithm--there was no need for me to write an entirely new explanation of it. Nobody else was going to read it--who the heck would care about this bizarre and largely irrelevant snippet of history? Why was I so compelled to typeset each equation perfectly?

Because creativity demands expression.

At the time, I didn’t see the creativity in my writeup. It was just technical writing; a purely pragmatic description of the steps which the computer takes to find the solution, like a brick wall of theorems and equations, one brick laid on top of the other.

Looking back, I can see my creativity in that wall. It is the mortar, filling in the gaps between the bricks. It is the order I chose to present things, the tone I chose to take on, the questions I chose to ask and answer, and the tangents I chose to go down to build a deeper intuition through the trickiest parts of the proof. And without it, the wall would collapse the moment someone leaned on it.
