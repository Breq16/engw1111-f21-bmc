          While there haven't been any rubrics in this course, there have
          certainly been criteria. Obviously, the grading contract sets out the
          criteria for the grade I want to get, but there are more criteria I've
          been working towards.
        </p>
        <p>
          First is my criteria for my role in the course. I wanted to write
          pieces that my peers would enjoy reading and hopefully learn from. I
          wanted to provide feedback that would motivate them to improve their
          writing.
        </p>
        <p>
          Second is my criteria for my own personal writing and growth. I knew I
          was going to be spending plenty of time writing for this course, and
          that this course would be an opportunity for me to improve my writing.
        </p>
        <p>
          I wanted to step out of my comfort zone for this class. I wanted to
          write about things I wasn't confident about, work with genres I wasn't
          familiar with, and push myself beyond the writing I'd done previously.
          I wanted to take advantage of the flexibility of the grading contract
          to take risks.

          I think I've met my expectations of myself here.{" "}
          <span className="italic">
            The Problem That Needs Fixing Is With The Chemicals In My Brain
          </span>{" "}
          started off with a topic that I wasn't entirely comfortable with.{" "}
          <span className="italic">Language: Expression</span> showed me a genre
          that was far outside my comfort zone.{" "}
          <span className="italic">Dynamic Music</span> mixed writing with my
          passions for software and music in a way I had never done before.{" "}
          <span className="italic">
            I Can't Explain The Most Important Piece I Ever Wrote
          </span>{" "}
          took a critical perspective to my own thoughts, which was a completely
          new idea for me. And{" "}
          <span className="italic">Measuring Identity</span> showed me how to
          start with a unique structure and fill in my experiences from there.

          In software development, many teams practice a methodology known as
          CI, or "Continuous Integration." Continuously presenting my work for
          review. Continuously testing to see what I can accomplish.
          Continuously building new pieces. Continuously taking risks, knowing
          that even if the end result doesn't work out the way I'd hoped,
          learning will still help me be a better writer.
